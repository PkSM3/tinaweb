This is the pure-web version of the tinaviz applet

see example.html to see how you can add it to you own blog, page, wiki, website..

you can disable the OpenGL rendering mode by replacing:
  
   <param name="engine" value="hardware" />

by

   <param name="engine" value="software" />
 

in the tinaviz/index.html document. WARNING: be aware that this param is present twice in the index.html document (for browser compatibility..) so you may want to use a search & replace.
